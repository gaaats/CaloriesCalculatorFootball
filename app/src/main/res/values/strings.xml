    <string name="text_activity_good">Football fever has got me thinking about the health benefits of playing the beautiful game. The complexity of training undertaken by a footballer means that they not only utilise their aerobic system, but their anaerobic system during a game too.

Aerobic exercise is when the oxygen you breathe is carried to your muscles via your lungs, and heart - to give them the energy they need to perform the activity. Aerobic exercise is therefore associated with lower intensity activity.

However, when the activity is performed at high intensities, the anaerobic system becomes the predominant energy system. This is because your anaerobic system can produce energy much more rapidly.</string>
