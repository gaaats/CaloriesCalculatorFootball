    <string name="text_activity_good">The benefits of squats are conditional if they are performed incorrectly. It is especially necessary to monitor the posture during this exercise, the incorrect position of the spine can lead to injury. And you canâ€™t do squats with a load (with weight) without the supervision of a coach or a powerlifting or bodybuilding professional! To maximize the benefits of squats, you must perform this exercise correctly. The back should be straight, slightly tilted forward. When squatting, keep your feet shoulder-width apart, this will protect you from falling and losing coordination.</string>
